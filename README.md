# Vim with Vigor
*A Reluctant Guide to the Editor You're Stuck With*

## About This Book

Welcome to the future, where AI editors like Cursor and Windsurf can practically write your code for you. Yet here you are, SSH'd into a production server at 2 AM, staring at the blinking cursor of Vim, wondering how you got here and—more importantly—how to get out.

This book is for the Emacs lover who's been forced into Vim's cold, modal embrace. It's for the modern developer who usually clicks buttons but sometimes needs to edit `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` on a remote server. It's for anyone who's ever typed `:q!` and felt a small victory.

Written with love (for Emacs) and resigned acceptance (of Vim's omnipresence), this guide will teach you just enough Vim to be dangerous—or at least, to edit files and exit successfully.

## Why This Book Exists

In Emacs, we have `M-x butterfly`. In Vim, we have... well, we have `:q!` and that's usually enough to get us out of trouble. But sometimes, just sometimes, you need to actually *use* Vim. This book is for those times.

Remember: Every expert Vim user was once someone who couldn't figure out how to exit. The difference is they never found the exit and eventually developed Stockholm syndrome.

Let's begin your journey into the land of modal editing, where every keystroke is an adventure and every mode switch is a small prayer that you're in the right one.
